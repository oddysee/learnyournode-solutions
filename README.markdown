Synopsis
-------------------------  
Solutions to [NodeSchool.io's Learn Your Node](http://nodeschool.io/#learn-you-node).

Motivation
----------
My first node.js code - made available to other learners so that they can verify that they're getting the answers.

Installation
----------------
Grab the [Vagrant box](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/838469/Debian7x64_NodeJS) which is a Debian 7 x64 dev environment with the latest version of Node.js built. Follow the [Get Started](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html) instructions for Vagrant, replacing references to _"precise32"_ with _"Debian7x64_NodeJS"_.

SSH into your vagrant box and run the code in /vagrant -
`learnyourcode run HelloWorld.js`

That's it.
